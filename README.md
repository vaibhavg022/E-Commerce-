# 🛋️ Tyre Furniture E-Commerce Website  

This project is a **prototype e-commerce website** designed for my startup idea of selling **furniture made from recycled tyres**. The goal is to create an **eco-friendly business** that combines **sustainability with creativity**.  

The website provides a complete **shopping experience** – from browsing furniture products to adding them to the cart – along with an **admin dashboard** to analyze revenue, profit, and sales.
